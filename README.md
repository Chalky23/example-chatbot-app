This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

`pnpm dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see and use the example chatbot.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Time to Explore!

To start using this example chatbot in your own projects, take a look at the [`link`](https://nextjs-chatbot-tutorial.notion.site/Create-your-own-AI-chatbot-in-a-Next-js-app-320c7872da0046e1850f8bcdca3536da#6b26aae8a6ec4dd4a078b7c636dcd635) here.

You will likely want to turn this into a component to use across different parts of your own project.

Try changing the CSS, formatting the response and changing the names used in the chat from 'User' and 'AI' to your specific use case.
